The original VULCAN code was written by Tsai et al. and the GitHub repository can be found here: https://github.com/exoclime/VULCAN while the theoretical papers here: [Tsai et al 2021.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01790) and [Tsai et al. 2017.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00409).

I have extended the code with rainout of water condensates and HCN.
